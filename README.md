# project-1
This account will be used to tweet daily kind reminders and mental health resources to assist queer people of color with their mental health and self love practices through the week. My mission is to promote the idea to queer BIPOC that taking care of yourself and expressing yourself freely in a world so antagonistic towards you, one that hates to see you thrive, can be a form of activism.
